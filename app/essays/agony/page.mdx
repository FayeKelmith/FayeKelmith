# Talking to Someone in Distress

<HeaderImageComponent />

Lately, I've found myself in deep, heartfelt conversations with close friends, sharing moments where they've shared the weight of their struggles. I felt humbled listening as they shared their agony, but every conversation leaves me with the dilemma of what an appropriate response should have been. Do I truly understand what they feel? In extreme cases -- when they uncontrollably break down in tears, my uncertainty on how to respond increases exponentially. They are having a vulnerable episode and trust that I would not let them down. The uncertainty of how useful I was burdens my heart. Did I say the right thing? Did I keep silent at the right moment? What effect will this conversation leave going forward? And I ask these questions because, I do not believe I ought to give advice.

Nassim Taleb lays this out more succinctly in his book Skin in the game, and I couldn't agree more. He explains that, we should be weary about those who wouldn't eat their own turtle. In his own words,

> Beware of the person who gives advice, telling you that a certain action on your part is “good for you” while it is also good for him,while the harm to you doesn’t directly affect him.

Essentially, when give advice, I do not **live** to bear suffering that comes with my "enlightenment". I do not have my skin in the game. It's fundamentally wrong for me to partake in the glory of the upside but bear the least repercussions for pitfalls. Advice solves the current problem of relief from the stress of thinking through the complex web of the issues at hand, but at the expense of a sophisticated, enduring solution to the longer lasting pain in the neck. Not a good formula for a "successful" conversation with someone in grief.

Which begs the question. When is advice solicited? A story, for another day. But it's fairly established that, advice is not the go to pattern for a conversation with someone in anguish.

If I cannot give advice, how can I be useful in the conversation? A paraphrase of this question and a better version is: what does the person need me to do for them?

In the book supercommunicators, Charles Duhigg proposes 3 reasons someone going through an emotional trauma would talk to you. He makes the case that they either want to be **heard, hugged or helped; triple H (3-H).** I will attempt deconstructing when which is appropriate.

"Foolishness is bound in the heart of a child; but the rod of correction shall drive it far from him." Proverbs 22: 15. When I was younger, my mother made good use of the rod. She whipped stubbornness out of my "heart"; Thank God, I still have some remains of useful stubbornness. I was so stubborn that it's hard to put in to words, but my super-mom had other plans; thank you "la mere for me". Eventually, I became immune to the beating. Every evening, I had a dose of Proverbs 22:15 ( I don't know who put that verse there, for God's sake!), and it became habit. I would go plug a coffee branch every evening when I identified a solid mishap I had engineered earlier that day. Eventually, the rod reached it's maximum capacity, no amount of whipping could solve my "Foolishness", but something else hit me. On days when my mom was super frustrated with work or familial issues, she would take it out on me, her words hit even harder. I would feel terrible not because of the whips (remember I got immunity on that already) but because of how she felt. When she would talk to me in pain. it was not so I could **help** her, or **hug** her (though it would be a great idea on a normal day,but remember I was the culprit for chaos in the first place), she would rather be **heard**. I didn't have to say anything, I just had to receive the correction and listen to her.

And we have all witnessed this. When you meet someone who has bottled up frustrations -- from wherever they are coming from -- and the sight of a fly is enough to make them go ballistic. They rant out their lamentations and with the least clarity in vision you will quickly realize that, it's not you they are furious with. They've been carrying heavy and they just needed to offload and you were there (at the wrong time). Those people just need to be **heard** -- and maybe **hugged, depending on their personality and your relationship with them.** More often that not, the content of their lamentation has absolutely nothing to do with you or the trigger. All they want to know is: **"I hear you."** Not that you have to say it out loud.
